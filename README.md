# Arch Linux System Cleaning Guide

This guide provides common commands and tips to clean and maintain your Arch Linux system by freeing up disk space and removing unnecessary files.

## Clear Package Cache

Arch Linux caches installed packages in `/var/cache/pacman/pkg/`. To remove old cached packages but keep the latest installed versions, run:

```bash
sudo paccache -r

To remove all cached packages (use with caution):

bash

sudo paccache -ruk0

Remove Orphaned Packages

Orphaned packages are dependencies no longer required by any installed package. Remove them with:

bash

sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)

Clean Systemd Journal Logs

Systemd journal logs can consume significant disk space. To limit their size to 100MB:

bash

sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M

To remove logs older than 2 weeks:

bash

sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks

Clear User Cache

User applications store cache files in ~/.cache. You can clean this directory manually or use tools like bleachbit.

bash

rm -rf ~/.cache/*

Additional Tips

    Remove unused configuration files.
    Remove old kernels if multiple versions are installed.

Use these commands carefully and ensure you have backups if necessary.

# Arch Linux System Maintenance and Cleanup

This document outlines essential commands and best practices for maintaining a clean and efficient Arch Linux system. Regular cleanup helps free disk space, remove unnecessary files, and optimize system performance.

---

## Package Cache Management

Arch Linux stores downloaded package files in the package cache located at `/var/cache/pacman/pkg/`. Over time, this cache can grow significantly.

- **Remove old cached packages while retaining the latest installed versions:**

  ```bash
  sudo paccache -r

    Remove all cached packages (use with caution):

    bash

    sudo paccache -ruk0

Orphaned Package Removal

Orphaned packages are dependencies that are no longer required by any installed package. Removing them helps reduce clutter:

bash

sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)

Systemd Journal Log Cleanup

Systemd journal logs can accumulate and consume considerable disk space. Manage logs effectively with the following commands:

    Limit journal size to 100MB:

    bash

sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M

Remove journal logs older than 2 weeks:

bash

    sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks

User Cache Cleanup

User applications often store cache files in the ~/.cache directory. Clearing this cache can free up space:

bash

rm -rf ~/.cache/*

Alternatively, consider using system cleaning tools such as bleachbit for a safer and more comprehensive cleanup.
Additional Recommendations

    Review and remove unused configuration files.
    Remove old or unused kernel versions to free space.
    Always ensure you have recent backups before performing system cleanup operations.

Note: Execute these commands with caution. Improper use may affect system stability or remove important data.

Maintaining a clean system contributes to better performance and efficient resource usage. Regularly schedule cleanup tasks as part of your system maintenance routine.
